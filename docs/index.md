This is a fixed (well not yet, but I'm working on it) fork of [toxicracker's DiscordUtils](https://github.com/toxicrecker/DiscordUtils)

# DiscordUtils
A very useful library made to be used with [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)

# Installation
For access to Pagination and InviteTracker use:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/pintermor9/DiscordUtils/
```

or, instead use the following for access to Music functions aswell
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pintermor9/DiscordUtils/
cd DiscordUtils
pip install .[voice]
```
Requires discord.py[voice] so make sure you have all dependencies of it installed.
